## Titanic Survival 

You can find more information regarding the challenge [in this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

### Setup

Conda has been used as the package manager. To setup conda see installation instructions [in this link](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html).
Once you have conda installed, use the first command to create a conda environment called kaggle with required packages specified in conda.txt. The second command activates the conda environment that we just created.

```
conda-env create -f conda.txt -n kaggle
conda activate kaggle
```

### Execute

Navigate to the notebook and start jupyter notebook

```
cd src/analysis/titanic-survival
jupyter notebook
```
